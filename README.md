### Introduction
The idea of this project is that we are enhancing a system for an existing database by adding a rating system for both the restaurants and the delivery drivers.

### Business Rules
* The project adds a rating system to an already existing database, the ratings are applied to both the restaurants and the delivery drivers.
* Persons can also be drivers, all delivery drivers are students.
* A person can order food one to many times, an individual order is tied to only one person for the order.
* The orders are for only one restaurant.
* The items on the order will only need to keep the total price and delivery charge, as well as keep the driver and delivery times.
* Locations where the food can be delivered, as well as a food delivery drop-off are included in the database.
